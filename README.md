# gizmo-stackdriver-logging

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/fsouza/gizmo-stackdriver-logging.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/fsouza/gizmo-stackdriver-logging)

This repository provides a library that aims to provide a
StackDriver-integrated logging library that follows
[Gizmo](https://github.com/NYTimes/gizmo)'s conventions for loading
configuration from the environment.

For an example of this library being used in a real-world Gizmo project, check
out the video-transcoding-api:
